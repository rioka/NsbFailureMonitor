This solution contains 4 projects
- NsbFailureMonitor.Messages
  Contains the messages
- NsbFailureMonitor.Server
  Defines the endpoint which processed command CreateOrder
  For thisendpoint, Heartbeat is enabled, so that we can get signalled when the service is alive or not
- NsbFailureMonitor.Client
  Client application which sends CreateOrder command
- NsbFailureMonitor.Monitor
  Endpoint listening for messages from ServiceControl; currently reports 
  * MessageFailed, published when a message is moved to the error queue
  * HeartbeatStopped, published when one endpoint seems not to be working
  * HeartbeatRestored, published when one endpoint comes back alive again

Heartbeat message from an endpoint are sent at predefined (configurable) interval of 10 seconds.
You can customize this internal by adding a key in appSettings

<configuration>
  ...
  <appSettings>
    ...
    <add key="heartbeat/interval" value="00:00:40" />
    ...
  </appSettings>
  ...
</configuration>

You should check HearbeatGracePeriod in ServiceControl settings, since it should be greater than the interval set for endpoints.
